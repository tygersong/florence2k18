		<h1>The Tyger</h1>
		<h1 style="font-size:15px"><i>By William Blake</i></h1>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza1">
		<p>
			Tyger Tyger, burning bright, <br>
			In the forests of the night; <br>
			What immortal hand or eye, <br>
			Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza2">
		<p>
			In what distant deeps or skies. <br>
			Burnt the fire of thine eyes? <br>
			On what wings dare he aspire? <br>
			What the hand, dare seize the fire?
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza3">
		<p>
			And what shoulder, & what art, <br>
			Could twist the sinews of thy heart? <br>
			And when thy heart began to beat, <br>
			What dread hand? & what dread feet? 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza4">
		<p>
			What the hammer? what the chain, <br>
			In what furnace was thy brain? <br>
			What the anvil? what dread grasp, <br>
			Dare its deadly terrors clasp! 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza5">
		<p>
			When the stars threw down their spears <br>
			And water'd heaven with their tears: <br>
			Did he smile his work to see? <br>
			Did he who made the Lamb make thee? 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza6">
		<p>
			Tyger Tyger burning bright, <br>
			In the forests of the night: <br>
			What immortal hand or eye, <br>
			Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
		</p>
	</div>
